This is one of my scripts for Quick, Draw! Doodle Recognition Challenge 
This not the best of my scores it is an architecture that i tried for the first time. kaggle enviorment used

A large encoder (resnet 50) is used
The decoder is small (custom)
This architecture helps reduce overfitting 
This is not the best architecture for the competition
but the data can used to try this arhitecture
